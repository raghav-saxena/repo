<h1>Evolution of Coronavirus Disease(COVID-19).</h1>
<hr>
<p>  
  Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).[14] Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn described in 1931 a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness. The chicks' mortality rate was 40–90%.[15] Fred Beaudette and Charles Hudson six years later successfully isolated and cultivated the infectious bronchitis virus which caused the disease.

	In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia with unknown etiology appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. Several of the initial patients visited a wet seafood market where other wildlife species were also sold. Subsequent virus isolation from human patients and molecular analysis showed that the pathogen was a new coronavirus (CoV), first named 2019-nCoV, and subsequently this disease was renamed by WHO as COVID-19. A study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) proposed the name SARS-CoV-2, but this name remains to be officially approved [1]. This new CoV is now the seventh member of the Coronaviridae known to infect humans. With the explosive increase of confirmed cases, the WHO declared this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020.
</p>
<p>
As animal markets had been implicated in the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002–2003, and initial 2019-nCoV infections are also related to the seafood market with wildlife trading, it was soon assumed that wild animals were also involved in the emergence of 2019-nCoV. Yet, from which species and under what circumstance the virus crossed the species barrier to infect humans remains to be clarified. Early investigations about the origin of COVID-19 suggested that the 2019-nCoV may have jumped from bats to human [42,43]. This is not unprecedented since bat viruses have been shown to ‘jump’ the species barrier frequently to infect new species [44., 45., 46., 47., 48., 49., 50.]. However, since bats were in hibernation when the outbreak occurred, and it was uncertain whether bats were sold at the market, the virus is more likely to have been transmitted via other species on the market. Genomic analyses of 2019-nCoV demonstrate a 96% nucleotide identity with a CoV isolated from a bat: BetaCoV/RaTG13/2013 [42]. Previous reports showed that species from the bat genera Rhinolophus in southern China are a rich pool of SARS-like-CoVs, which belong to the subgenera Sarbecovirus. These viruses exhibit rich genetic diversity and frequent recombination events, which may increase the potential for cross-species transmission [7,42,51., 52., 53., 54., 55.]. Here, we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the 2019-nCoV cluster (Box 1). Based on recombination analysis and phylogenetic trees (Figure 2A), we found that 2019-nCoV shares a most recent common ancestor with BetaCoV/RaTG13/2013 (EPI_ISL_402131), because both viruses are in the same cluster.

A cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China on 31 December 2019.  On 7 January Chinese authority identified a new type of coronavirus as a cause of pneumonia outbreak, which is different from any other human coronaviruses discovered so far. The new strain is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and disease as COVID-19. While communicating with public, World Health Organization (WHO) has begun referring to the virus as “the virus responsible for COVID-19” or “the COVID-19 virus”.
This outbreak was declared as a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” (PHEIC) on 30th January 2020 by WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) and subsequently WHO declared it pandemic on 11th March, 2020.
