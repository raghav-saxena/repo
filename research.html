<h1>Global Research on Coronavirus Disease(COVID-19).</h1>
<hr>
<p>
	WHO is bringing the world’s scientists and global health professionals together to accelerate the research and development process, and develop new norms and standards to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and help care for those affected.</p>
<p>
WHO is gathering the latest international multilingual scientific findings and knowledge on COVID-19. The global literature cited in the WHO COVID-19 database is updated daily (Monday through Friday) from searches of bibliographic databases, hand searching, and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles.
Solidarity II is a global collaboration led by the World Health Organization that promotes the implementation of serological surveys of SARS-CoV-2. Solidarity II provides a collaborative environment for public health agencies and academic institutions around the world to work together to answer some of the most urgent questions about the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p>
<p>  
There is increasing concern that patients with COVID-19 might be at risk of developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis co-infection. A Comment, published in The Lancet Microbe, found in a cohort of 221 patients with COVID-19 in China, fungal infections were diagnosed in seven individuals, all of whom were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Less than 100 days since the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about the new coronavirus, research has accelerated at incredible speed.
More than 200 patients have already been randomly assigned to one of the studies, he said.  While randomized clinical trials normally take years to design and conduct, the Solidarity Trial will reduce the time taken by 80%, according to WHO.
</p>
<p>
The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
A  statement from the Emergency Committee advised that the partners also identify “the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts…which will enable targeted interventions and a research agenda to reduce the risk of similar events”.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
The CDC defines “close contact” as either 1) a “prolonged period of time” spent “within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) or within the room or care area” of an individual who has been positively diagnosed with the virus or 2) “direct contact with infectious secretions.” Examples include sharing eating or drinking utensils, close conversation, or kissing, hugging, and other direct physical contact. “Close contact” does not include activities such as walking by a person or briefly sitting across a waiting room or office.
</p>

The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. 	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that can cause mild illness in the form of common cold to severe respiratory diseases such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. A novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic; it means they can be transmitted between animals and people. Previous investigations showed that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans.
Common symptoms of infection may be in the form of respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. Treatment is only supportive. A number of antivirial targets have been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication. A number of vaccines using different methods are also under development for different human coronaviruses.
There are no antiviral drugs to treat animal coronaviruses.	
</p>
<hr>
<p>
There are four main ways to protect yourself from COVID-19: 
<ol>
<li>Pay attention to personal hygiene</li>
<li>Practice social distancing</li>
<li>Wear a face covering in public, and</li>
<li>Keep surfaces clean.</li>
</ol>
