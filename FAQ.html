<h1> <u>General FAQs</u></h1>  
<h2>What is the 2019 novel coronavirus</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The 2019 novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, is a new respiratory virus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It’s called a “novel” — or new — coronavirus, because it is a coronavirus that has not been previously identified.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Where did COVID-19 come from?</h2>
<p>
COVID-19 is the same type of coronavirus as MERS and SARs, both of which originated in bats. Many of the first people to contract COVID-19 in Wuhan either worked or frequently shopped at a large seafood and live-animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What are the symptoms and signs of COVID-19?</h2>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever greater than 100.4°F (38.0°C), dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Some patients also experience aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or diarrhea. These symptoms typically begin gradually. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?</h2>
<hr>
<p>COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Based on what we know now, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 are:

People aged 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility

<h2>Should I be tested for COVID-19?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Maybe; not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
<hr>
</span></p>
<button onclick="myFunction2()" id="myBtn2">Read more</button>
<h2>Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?</h2>
<hr>
<p>No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults.<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. It's not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.<hr>
</span></p>
<button onclick="myFunction3()" id="myBtn3">Read more</button>
<h2>How does COVID-19 spread?</h2>
<hr>
<p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.<span id="dots4">.. </span><span id="more4"> The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick</p>
