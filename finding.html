How can be found COVID-19 infected people?</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This is the most serious topic of finding COVID 19 infected people.
we can found them via the following symptoms:-
persons that are surfing from one state or country to another.
persons that are suffering from cuff & cold with fever.
persons that have low immunity power and stay connected with the crowd they also may be COVID infected if they are not using proper masks and sanitizer.  
</p>
<hr>
<p>
We can also find COVID infected people using the Aarogya Setu app powered by the government of India.
India has created an app called Aarogya Setu that will use Bluetooth technology to keep an eye on covid-19 patients or suspected cases that need to be quarantined.
The new app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology will also share user data with the government in case anyone has been in contact with a person who has tested positive for coronavirus.
</p>
<hr>
<p>  
The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.
